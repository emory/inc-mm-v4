# No Thirteenth

Two weeks after I started my partial hospitalization program, and two days before our 12th wedding anniversary, Liz told me that she thought she wanted a divorce. She told me that she was 95% certain. 

I was 95% certain that she should have killed me so that I'd never have to know.

# Born in Fire

Liz and I met the summer of 2001. I was still living in *NoVA*, and she was an undergrad at NYU visiting a friend for the summer in Maryland. We moved pretty quickly, but the real gasoline on our grassfire was 9/11. In the course of one day I became acquainted with her parents in Connecticut, and was trying to get her out of Manhattan on what would end up being the last train to leave Penn Station. 

She stayed with me for a few weeks in the aftermath of a tragedy that defined a generation. We were both a bit shaken, but while I could see the smoke from the pentagon, she watched the second plane strike the tower in the rear-view mirror of her shuttle. Eventually she had to go back but the cement had formed around us and it was something that I found really comforting for the next 16 years.

There were times where Liz would mention this and ask me if I thought that event was why we were together at all. I would usually think it wasn't a nice thing to say to me, and I don't know the answer because it's impossible to know. I couldn't be mad about it or anything, because I had the same thought now and then but I didn't know what I was supposed to do with any answer I arrived at. Four years later we would get married in January at the Bellagio. 

Before that summer in 2001, I used to really want to be married. There were two people I felt like I wanted to be married to by then! I changed my mind somewhere between 2001 and 2003, and I was suddenly certain I didn't want to ever get married. I had a hard time feeling secure enough but also was unwilling to really go all-in on any one person. Any reason or justification I have for any of it is completely clichÃ© and unoriginal. Essentially it all boils down to being symptomatic anyway.

In 2003, [The Station Nightclub Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Station_nightclub_fire) in Providence resulted in the death of some colleagues in Guardent's RI office. I was working in Old Town Alexandria in the Consulting and Professional Services team, and I volunteered to pitch in with the engineering team in Providence. I was comfortable in managed services already and it was work I'd done before, so they took me up on my offer. I stayed with Liz's parents and siblings for a few days in Ledyard and commuted to Providence. While I was there I made friendships with people that will last a lifetime. It wound up being a week-long job interview of sorts. I was offered a position up there, and I accepted it. 

When Liz graduated from NYU, she moved in with me in Providence. We lived on the East Side of Providence, and we lived off Hope St., like the old poster says: 

![Providence, Rhode Island where it rains two days out of three except during the rainy season when it snows like a bitch, and Friendship is a one-way street. Rich folks live on Power Street, but most of us live off Hope.](http://www.madpeck.com/grafix/posters/ProvColorWM.jpg)

She asked me to get married a few times before I said yes. I wasn't trying to be difficult but I did want to be sure that she meant it, and I didn't want anything but certainty that I wanted it too. When I got sure enough, I said yes. 

> There were a few months during the early years of our marriage that were painful and difficult. I have to think about finding a way to write about it without telling someone else's story. The short version is that my wife asked me for something, and I refused because reasons, and we separated for a while. It was not the root cause of all our problems, but it was not immaterial either.

# The Great Unraveling

The next two weeks were very chaotic, emotionally. I felt betrayed and deceived, and I left my partial hospitalization to redouble my efforts in individual therapy and couples therapy. This new development is what would drive our couples therapy agenda for the next two months. There were many disappointing and agonizing developments in there, but eventually we arrive at a very affirmative and constructive place. It was impossible for me to see that place from where I started, though. 

I will attempt to paraphrase my understanding of how we got to the place where staying with me was not an option anymore: My wife has been trying to reach me for years, but that I couldn't or wouldn't find a way to her from the darkness I found so comfortable. It has gotten to the point where she cannot be the person she wants to be while fighting against the ceaseless tide of my emotional seas. 

My initial reaction to this was incredulous anger, and I resented this entire characterization; She knew I was depressed and suffered from chronic anxiety when we met. This is the status quo and my atttempts to get better have not been that productive. I knew she was nearing the end of her patience with me and my mental health and that this day could come. That was why I finally started taking drastic and much larger steps, like that partial hospital program. In couple's therapy we would talk about this being a possible outcome and one session in particular I acknowledged this. I thought that I had about six months to get my shit together. 

@@edit
I was actually out of time. First it was 95% certain I was out of time, and it's *very hard* to not blame outside factors in this, but it doesn't even matter anymore. It seemed to me like Liz spent this intermission whittling her remaining 5% to a 0%. I tried very hard to give her some distance in this span of time, which is almost impossible. ***When there is an empty space between us, I want to rush in and fill it.***

> This is precisely one of things that I would do that contributed to one of the reasons she needed to leave: the two of us were apparently very good at convincing her to set her feelings and needs aside in order to let the current dynamic between us continue largely unchanged.

## Patterns

Part of this narrative I resented was that we were in these rigid roles that we couldn't change. My objection to this was that I knew it could be changed. And as we continued to sort things out I realized that repairing and fixing our marriage was something that was right on front of our noises for over a year. It felt like a tragedy that could have been avoided or could have been repaired so easily. 

That was how I felt about it until I came across my project in OmniFocus.

## The Marriage

The software I use for handling all the various projects and tasks I am in the middle of is called OmniFocus. I use it on my iPhone, my iPad, and my Macs. It's one of the most important pieces of software I use on a daily basis because it brings order to what is otherwise an attention deficient dumpster fire. 

I had a project in OmniFocus called *The Marriage*. It had been created years ago and was where I shoved conversations to have, or things to do that were related to growing our marriage. Even when it was great, it was something worth investing in.

My wife and I can probably both point to the same day two years ago before Calvin was born that was probably where our marriage as we knew it was over. We were right on the verge of a complete break-down and I had a moment where I felt like my marriage wasn't the only thing in jeopardy. I immediately back-peddled and changed gears entirely. I resolved to find a way to get what I needed another way, and we began treading water.

After that day I had this idea in my head that we needed to "ratify" or revisit what our marriage was. I was actually open to the idea that it would have to end at the conclusion of that process, but what really hit me was when I looked at that project and saw how little the things I assigned to *The Marriage* were being touched. So while I was angry with Liz for not simply saying "we're in trouble and I want to fix it", I had sixty tasks that sat there demanding my attention too, and I wasn't doing a damned thing about them, either. 

That was the moment it stopped being a disaster, and more of a disappointment. One that I had participated in passively, if not demanded by my own inaction.

# A Very Bad Day

We contacted our Realtor and she met with us to give us an idea of what we were going to do. We didn't think it was likely that either of us keep our home, and our Realtor was very decisive and wanted to move quickly to get out house under contract. I felt a little pressured on this but didn't see the point in pumping the brakes. 

Once we were on this course, Liz took to preparing the house for showings and photos. There was a day where I came back to the house because I couldn't find one of my medications. It was an anti-anxiety medication, and I was feeling wicked twitchy without it. I came home while Liz was leaving, and stepped inside the house and I felt the floor open beneath me; the foyer was empty, and looking down the stairs to the living room it was like nobody even lived there anymore. 

I was a little dizzy and my pulse was loudly pushing blood through my ears. I absentmindedly walked across my living room and remembered how much I loved this house and something I said when our offer was accepted on it. 

I had meant that I could live there for a very long time, but it suddenly had a different weight to it. What followed was a completely unexpected and terrifying few hours. I had some friends checking on me, I had a best friend helping me through this moment and I wrote something much more detailed here but couldn't bear for my children to read it someday, so I have removed it entirely and leave it as an exercise to the reader to read between the lines. You're probably right, whatever you came up with. 

## Exodus

I sent Liz a message that I was going to stay with my aunt and uncle that night. I honestly didn't know how long I'd be gone, and I filled them in on how things were going at dinner. They were appropriately supportive and kind to me, and it felt good to reach out to some family and have them grab on and not let me float away into outer space.

I didn't think I could tell Liz what had actually happened, but I didn't want her thinking it was something trivial and I was being overly dramatic. She had a pretty good idea of the situation soon enough. 

I was feeling better that night and got some sleep. My dreams were nightmares, but when I woke up I was glad they weren't real. They were worse than my reality, and that was somewhat comforting.
