<h4>Beware: Falling Serifs</h4>
<p>This is part three of an ongoing series I'm calling <a href="https://incumbent.org/sad/">I've Been Sad</a></p>
</div>

First of all I'd just like to say that this is the hardest part of this series that I've written yet. I wanted to write this back in April, but I couldn't have written it then, and doing so would have meant sharing some private matters with the public at large before the appropriately members of our private lives were up to speed. A lot has happened between now and then, and I'll do my best to make sense of it all as we go.

# No Thirteenth

Two weeks after I started my partial hospitalization program, and two days before our 12th wedding anniversary, Liz told me that she thought she wanted a divorce. She told me that she was 95% certain. 

I was 95% certain that she should have killed me so that I'd never have to know.

# Born in Fire

Liz and I met the summer of 2001. I was still living in *NoVA*, and she was an undergrad at NYU visiting a friend for the summer in Maryland. We moved pretty quickly, but the real gasoline on our grassfire was 9/11. In the course of one day I became acquainted with her parents in Connecticut, and was trying to get her out of Manhattan on what would end up being the last train to leave Penn Station. 

She stayed with me for a few weeks in the aftermath of a tragedy that defined a generation. We were both a bit shaken, but while I could see the smoke from the pentagon, she watched the second plane strike the tower in the rear-view mirror of her shuttle. Eventually she had to go back to New York, but the cement had formed around us and would eventually be reinforced by sixteen years and two children.

There were a few times where Liz would mention 9/11 and ask me if I thought that event was why we were together. I would usually think it wasn't a nice thing to say to me, I felt like maybe she wondered why she was even with me at all and was looking for a reason. I don't know the answer because it's impossible to know. I couldn't be mad about it or anything, because I had the same thought now and then,  but I didn't know what I was supposed to do with any answer I might arrive at. I didn't want it to make any decisions for me.

Before that summer in 2001, I used to really want to be married. There were two people I felt like I wanted to be married to by then! I changed my mind somewhere between 2001 and 2003, and I was suddenly certain I didn't want to ever get married. I had a hard time feeling secure in a relationship, but also was unwilling to really go all-in on any one person. Any reason or justification I have for any of it is completely cliché and unoriginal. Essentially it all boils down to being predictably symptomatic anyway. 

Several years ago when we were first in trouble, I made sure I was fully both-feet committed to my marriage, and this added an extra bit of backspin to her telling me that she wanted a divorce. I don't regret it at all, but it didn't make it easier.

# The Great Unraveling

The next two weeks were very chaotic, emotionally. I often felt betrayed and even deceived. I left my partial hospitalization to redouble my efforts in individual therapy and our couples therapy. This new development is what would drive our couples therapy agenda for the next two months. There were many disappointing and often agonizing developments in there, but eventually we arrive at a very affirmative and constructive place. 

I will attempt to paraphrase my understanding of how we got to the breaking point, where staying married to me was not an option anymore: my wife has been trying to reach me for years, but I couldn't or wouldn't find a way to her as a well-balanced and functional human. I resisted being better for whatever reason, and it had gotten to the point where she could no longer tolerate not being the person she wants to be, while also fighting against the ceaseless tide of my emotional seas. She was living most of her life on eggshells now, setting aside her own wants and needs to accommodate my own nebulous and wildly varied demands to *feel* a certain way, without ever being able to tie it to actual actions. She resented the pressure I put on her to manage my emotions — **I had successfully made her responsible for my feelings, and her attempts to free herself from them were thwarted by our patterns of relating to each other.** 

My initial reaction to this was incredulous anger, and I resented this entire characterization; She knew I was depressed and suffered from chronic anxiety when we met. This was the status quo and my attempts to get better have not been that productive. I knew she was nearing the end of her patience with me and my mental health and that this day could come. That was why I finally started taking drastic and much larger steps, like that partial hospital program. In couple's therapy we would talk about our marriage and that ending it could be a possible outcome. *I thought that I had about six months to get my shit together or we'd be through.*

I was actually out of time. We had a brief window where her 95% certainty would work it's way towards 100%, and while it's *very hard* to not blame outside factors in this, it doesn't even matter anymore. [^havingsaidthat] I tried very hard to give her some emotional distance in this span of time, which is almost impossible. ***When there is an empty space between us, I want to rush in and fill it.*** She knew that would happen, so **she built a wall that I could not climb**. I would sometimes throw myself at it and I often felt that I was going through this process completely on my own and that she wasn't grieving or processing all of this in a way I could recognize. It was very disorienting and hurtful, and yet it was the right thing to do. 

> This is precisely one of things that I would do that contributed to one of the reasons she needed to leave: the two of us were apparently very good at convincing her to set her feelings and needs aside in order to let the current dynamic between us continue largely unchanged.
{: .notice--warning}

## Radical Vulnerability 

From the start, Liz told me she had this vision of a *Collaborative Divorce*, which is a real thing. In Iowa it isn't part of the law, but the objective is very similar: work together and be the best possible co-parents you can be. The problem I was facing regularly was that I was so hurt and wounded that I'd get a streak of vindictiveness or anger that wanted to lash out at Liz and make her feel as hurt as I did, especially because it so often seemed that this was all completely so easy for her. Why was I the only one that had to hurt? 

It would take some time before I got there, but in the mean time I adopted a posture of leaving myself wide open. I didn't hire an attorney for quite a while. I didn't take the well-intentioned advice I may receive of family and friends to retain counsel and do everything I could to protect myself from this assault on my sanity and family and extract my wife from my life like a surgeon might remove a tumor.

I was a complete disaster to her, I'm sure, but I had to do it this way and let myself get pummeled now and then because the alternative was going to make it even worse. I had a lot of anxiety about this because I knew ultimately that if I burned her to the ground like the more angry and spiteful parts of me wanted to see, how could I look at myself in the mirror every day to do something so terrible to the woman I've loved all these years? What would I say to our children? It was an easy decision to not wall myself off. I understood why she did it, but I didn't have to do it that way and it's for everyone's benefit that I do not go down that road.

## Patterns

Part of the narrative she had for the state of our marriage that I especially resented was that we were in these rigid roles that we couldn't change. My objection to this was that I *knew* it could be changed. People can evolve and change, it happens all the time! Why must we scuttle the ship when all we need to do is rededicate ourselves, again, to repairing this relationship?

That was how I felt about it until I came across my project in OmniFocus.

### The Marriage

The software I use for handling all the various projects and tasks I am in the middle of is called OmniFocus [^omnifocus]. I use it on my iPhone, my iPad, and my Macs. It's one of the most important pieces of software I own, and I use on a daily basis because it brings organization to what is otherwise an attention deficit dumpster fire. Not even kidding a little.

For quite some time, I had a project in OmniFocus called *The Marriage*. It had been created years ago (!) and was where I shoved notes about conversations to have, or things to do that were related to growing our marriage. Even when it was great, it was something worth investing in. 

My wife and I can both point to the same day two years ago before Calvin was born that was probably where our marriage, as we knew it, was officially over. I was relentlessly thrashing as I often did, craving a *feeling* and asking her for something she would **never** give me. We were right on the verge of a complete break-down and I had a moment where I felt like my marriage wasn't the only thing in jeopardy. I immediately back-peddled and changed gears entirely to end the conversation before it took the next logical step. I was mere moments away from ending it all in desperation, but instead I resolved to find a way to get what I needed another way, and we began treading water. 

> I would never be able to find what I needed another way because I was looking in the wrong place entirely, but I couldn't recognize or accept that yet. It's a very hard lesson to learn that some of the things you most desperately need are things that can only come from yourself. 
{: .notice--warning}

After that day I had this idea in my head that we needed to "ratify" or revisit what our marriage was. I was actually open to the idea that it would have to end at the conclusion of that process or that at least some pretty large aspects of it would have to be vastly different. That was a hard thing to admit to myself, but what really hit me hard was when I looked at that project in OmniFocus that I scrolled past for so long now every time I did a review of my active projects, I saw how little effort was applied to all the things I assigned to *The Marriage*. They simply weren't being touched very much at all! 

So while I was angry with Liz for not simply saying "we're in trouble and I want to fix it", I had sixty tasks that sat there demanding attention of my own. I've been telling *myself* "we're in trouble and I want to fix it", yet those tasks just sat there collecting dust along with my marriage.

In that moment, it stopped being a 24/7 catastrophe. It was a profoundly sad disappointment. And worse still, it was one that I had participated in passively, if not demanded by my own inaction.

# A Very Bad Day

We contacted our Realtor and she met with us to give us an idea of what we were going to do. We didn't think it was likely that either of us could keep our beautiful home [^ashley], and our Realtor was very decisive and wanted to move quickly to get out house under contract. I felt a little pressured on this but didn't see the point in pumping the brakes. 

Once we were on this course, Liz took to preparing the house for showings and photos. There was a day where I came back to the house because I couldn't find one of my medications while I was at work. It was an anti-anxiety medication, and I was feeling especially twitchy that day without it. I came home while Liz was leaving, and stepped inside the house and I felt the floor open beneath me — the foyer was empty, and looking down the stairs to the living room it was like nobody even lived there anymore. 

I was a little dizzy and my pulse was loudly pushing blood through my ears. I absentmindedly walked across my living room and remembered how much I loved this house and something I said to Liz when our offer was accepted on it. I hadn't even realized what I had been doing with my body while my mind went elsewhere. 

> I've written about what happened next three times and every time I look at it afterwards it's not something I want to publish. 
{: .notice--warning}

In a panic, I made it back to my car and somehow I made it to the parking garage where my friend Mari would rescue me over the telephone. I don't use that word lightly. It was a rescue. I never thought I would be in that place, but I was there. I have never been in peril like that before and I was resolved to never be in that situation again. It's one of the reasons I started writing about all of this in the first place. It was her and my friends in *Finding Water* that got me through that day.

## Exodus

Crisis averted, I sent Liz a message that I was going to stay with my aunt and uncle in a neighboring city that night. I honestly didn't know how long I'd be gone, and I hadn't talked to many people in my family except my parents about what had been going on. I filled the two of them in over dinner. They were appropriately supportive and kind to me, and it felt good to reach out to some family and have them grab on and not let me float away into outer space.

I was feeling better that night and got some sleep. My dreams were nightmares, but when I woke up I was glad they weren't real. They were worse than my reality, and that was somewhat comforting.

# Catching-Up

Every single day I was processing things that it felt like Liz had already gone through months before me. She was way out in front and dragging me along to this unlikely scenario where we are collaborators and raising our children amicably. Most of the time it still sounded like a complete fantasy in spite of my attempts to make it impossible for me to assume an aggressive posture. A lot of people get divorced in my family and they are usually bloodbaths. Especially when children are involved.

She was through the worst of it long before I got there, and she was already moving on. It felt like I couldn't catch my breath or get a break anywhere I turned — sometimes it felt like she was actively trying to break me. She was done delaying whatever she wanted to preserve my feelings. She could not possibly be any clearer about that. I made some boundaries of my own and I felt like she couldn't believe I was standing up to her; I had decided that our marriage ending was not going to be something that happened to me. 

I was going to show up, and I was **not** going to continue to watch it all happen to me from the bottom of a well I had fallen into twenty years ago.

## An Excursion in Philadelphia

I had a plan. It was risky and could easily get away from me if I wasn't careful, but I knew what to do. I made plans to fly to Philadelphia and see one of my best friends who would babysit me for at least eight hours.

    <figcaption>"With eyes so dilated I've become her pupil."</figcaption>
</figure>

I often felt like the pain and loss I was feeling hunted me and stalked me. It would overtake me when I was alone in the house or in my car and sometimes I would plead with it to leave me alone and let go of me. I was being devoured by it so messily and it wasn't ever going to stop. It was this endless torment that chased me everywhere I went and I couldn't get any distance between myself and the grief that had my scent.

There was a moment that day in Philadelphia where I was completely wide open with nowhere to hide. I asked this painful feeling, why? Why is this happening? And what is going to happen to me? 

Only more uncertainty was the response. It wouldn't stop, it was relentless, and I couldn't get away from it. I begged it to let go of me. Over and over again: *let go, let go.* And in my head in that moment the sound of the voice changed, and it wasn't me saying it anymore. It was Liz. She wasn't angry, and she didn't sound hurt. She was urging me though, to let go. *To let her go*.

### ***To let her go, because she was already gone.***

In my mind I sliced my hand like a blade through the mooring lines of memories and aspirations. The hopes and dreams and disappointments and everything in-between were now severed, and we could shrug it all off. Something really beautiful happened in the silence of that room while I caught my breath and finally felt some peace.

I cut her free. I cut *myself* free. But there was something that could not be cut. I could see Liz in the distance, now unfettered, but there was a wire between us that remained. On that wire, strung up like little paper dolls between us, were our children.

	<figcaption>We can't stop here. This is bat country.</figcaption>
</figure>

For weeks I was so afraid of losing something. It felt like everything. But I didn't even know that I was afraid of losing something I no longer even had. It instantly reframed everything and I was suddenly not in the midst of an existential crisis because my marriage was ending. All that mattered to me at that point was that we were family for the rest of our lives, and that I needed to figure out what kind of family I wanted that to be as quickly as possible, because I had a lot of work to do.

> There may have been several epiphanies that day. Among them, I came to terms with probably never having a Great Love like Liz again. It just seemed so impossible to consider ever letting anyone back into my heart like that again. If I had my one chance at a Great Love and I blew it, that would be a valuable lesson to not take things for granted.
{: .notice--warning}

# Mercifully Shattered

I was calm, and at peace. Yet, I had been shattered. Completely shattered into a million pieces, and it was the most terrible thing that ever happened, but it was also the best thing that ever happened. It would be what allowed me to someday soon feel the best I've ever felt and be the best I've ever been. I had built a dense impenetrable shell around me that couldn't be removed, and the only way to escape from it was to smash it all to pieces and rebuild myself with gold.

A month later in our therapist's office I would say that I felt like I couldn't let myself be happy. I'd say that I was afraid that my happiness was a symptom, an artificial echo of happiness that my brain built for me to further deceive me right before it tightened a noose around my neck and lowered me further into new darkness. I had manic episodes before that lifted my mood for a few days only to crash even harder, but Liz shook her head before I could finish the sentence and she would tell me she has seen what I was talking about before, but that this wasn't it. In fact, she would say that she's **never** seen me this happy and content, not since we met. I was filled with relief and gratitude. Then I'd tell Liz that I would not have been brave enough to ever end our marriage, and that I was grateful she was able to start this process. And then she was filled with relief and gratitude too. We were both finally settling into our new relationship, and we were both trusting each other again.

## Getting Better

My therapy is making huge inroads. I have some real breakthrough moments that I've never experienced before. I am becoming more *self-lead*, as my therapist says. Like she predicted, my writing improves and more importantly, my photography improves. When I ask Mari about this at one point she tells me that she can see a change also, and that my photos are less self-aware and less technical. That I'm shooting from my gut. Finally. **Finally!**

This was one of the things that I was able to admit to myself before I could admit I was feeling happiness again. It was evident in my work, and I saw it. I still needed a trusted observer like my wife and our therapist to fill in the gaps for me, but I felt vindicated. I felt like I was improving. I felt like for the first time in twenty years, I was getting better.

# Momentum

Our house sold in a day. It sold the day I was in Philadelphia and engaged in my fantastic voyage and en route to being shattered. We accepted an offer and were under contract and began looking for places of our own. We hadn't yet talked to our children about our divorce, but Calvin wasn't even two years old until July, so he's pretty much rolling with life and doesn't really have a well constructed reality yet. He is the same age I was when my parents divorced, and I had a lot of anxiety and concerns about all of this. We talked to Prudence about our divorce at dinner one night, and I was so afraid of making her sad or being anxious about this, but she was remarkably resilient. The things she found interesting were that she'd have two bedrooms, and two houses, and that she and her brother would spend time living in both of them. This was a little strange for her to wrap her head around, but she didn't seem too concerned about the part where her parents weren't going to be married. Our circumstances were different than some, so there was no weird conversation about the nature of love because Liz and I still love each other. It is a decidedly different love than it was, say, two years ago, but we love our children and each other and our family is going to change in a lot of ways but it's going to be the same in others. 

Ultimately it will become clear to me that **it is going to be better**, because Liz and I will rapidly begin to be more than we were as a couple. This is the part that is easy to ignore, because someone may tell you that children are better off with two married parents. My response to that is going to be: maybe. In our case, I think our children are getting a tremendous benefit in our divorce because my children are getting a dramatically more engaged and capable father, and their mother isn't living her life between my mood swings and resenting me. [^orly]

## The Details

We have until the end of May when the buyers close on our house, so we scramble. I hold off a bit to see where Liz ends up, because our therapist recommends avoiding any disparities in households. We decide our attorneys are expensive enough and that we can bang out most of our settlement and parenting plan with a mediator, who is also a therapist and is exceptionally adept at facilitating Liz and I deciding how we are going to raise our children and dividing up our household. 

We have property spreadsheets where we make decisions on who-gets-what. I'm reading books on co-parenting. I'm finally feeling optimistic and ready to embrace this transition. Mari tells me something I'll never forget about her own divorce, and it's that she's as proud of her divorce as she was her marriage. She tells me that she's a a better parent because of it, and in hindsight I can tell you that I feel exactly the same way. 

I write *vows* for our divorce into our parenting plan. They read:

* We will treat each other with love and respect, and have a relationship as co-parents that we are proud of.
* We will speak of each other in a way that conveys trust and esteem for one another when talking to our children, and our communities.
* We will honor the relationships our children have with each of us. We will honor and respect each other as parents, and as integral members of our family.
* We will trust each other as collaborators, and we will work together for the benefit of our family.
* We will prepare our children for the transitions between households and work together to make these transitions as smooth as possible.

We know there will be hiccups and conflicts but we have seen them happen already and we have seen that we can get through them together. It's strange, but this is the most engaged we have been with each other in a long time. The nature of our marriage necessitated that we be really good at communicating really intense and difficult things with each other, and it's a valuable asset that we rely on to this day, and likely for the rest of our lives. 

After Liz's offer is accepted and rescinded on one house, she locks a different one down. I am kind of crunched for time and afraid I'll be unable to find something I want to own until I come across a house that is ready to roll and can be quickly closed. At the end of May we leave the house we bought together a year before, and are settling into our own separate households. We start our shared custody arrangement, and our children see both of us every day except on weekends. Prudence starts kindergarten in the fall, and we are considering a longer series, but for now this summer we are in a 1/1/1/1/3 schedule and use our kid's daycare as our transition point. So far there has been only one incident where Prudence expressed some concern or anxiety about our divorce and it was something Liz was able to address easily and hasn't come up since. We don't discourage our children from talking about the other parent and we both respect and love each other so there isn't a lot of tension or weirdly inappropriate manipulation going on. Calvin likes that there's a picture of his big sister at the top of the stairs where she's being held by his mamma. Prudence has pictures of her family everywhere she looks. We try to do things as a group when we can and Prue's birthday party is a good example of that. 

Miraculously, we are pulling this off. Since January I feel like I've lived ten lifetimes. I have been utterly defeated and wrecked by a relationship ending all around me, suffered what can only be described as a complete and categorical rejection, and somehow I am nearing the other side of this and I feel great. When Liz first uttered the phrase "collaborative divorce", I thought she was out of her goddamned mind, but here we are. Our children are happy, and thriving, and Liz and I are doing the same. I feel like the jump to Kindergarten will be tough on Prue, but not because of our divorce. Liz and I wound up getting houses within .25 miles of each other, and we're also both .25 miles from the elementary school. We are close, *but not too close*. We still have some practical and organizational things to get sorted out, but we have been doing this now for a few months without much headache. 

We are not yet divorced, but are now sewing up our agreement and getting everything ready for judges to sign off on. I don't think either of us is in a huge hurry to be done with it already, but we are both certain this is the right thing to do. I think we will probably be officially divorced by October, and not a lot will be different from it is right now.

To top it all off, as we've been working all this out, *our hearts are not irrevocably damaged by this after all,* but that's only partially my story to tell and I'm sure I'll have plenty to say about it soon.

# So What

Before you find yourself asking what this has to do with mental health, I'd like to say go fuck yourself. This entire series of events would absolutely have me chained to a goddamned hospital bed nine months ago. Were it not for my actual *team* of therapists, the partial hospital program, my med manager, my BFFs: Eric and Mari, Albert Hoffman, and some musical selections, I'd probably be dead. I'm not even kidding. Dead.

This has been a very chaotic few months, and I am now (end of July, 2017) starting to get ready to make another run at the next cluster of problematic parts in therapy. I've had some complications over the last two months and I'm worried that I'll start to backslide. I have the right structure in place to support me, but as you may have figured out by now, I don't do easy. I have some tricky navigation to do and I've been delaying it as much as possible because I have just been so grateful to have a victory or three for a change! After having so much of my life be a series of emergencies that I retreat from, finally seeing myself actually improve in measurable ways has been worth celebrating.

## Having said that

Now it's time to leave the party and get back to work.

## Radical Divorce

One of the better sources of inspiration when I was especially confused was [Radical Divorce](https://radicaldivorce.com) which is the product of a friend of a friend. I really liked what I read there and it was the source of some optimism that I sometimes wasn't ready for, but eventually got there.
