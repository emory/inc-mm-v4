# Current Projects 

These are some creative projects I'm working on that I am very interested in finding subjects for. If you wish to contact me about any of them, please contact me using one of the methods outlined on [my 'about' page](/about/) or by [filling out this form](https://incumbent.org/contact/). 

*C'mon, don't be shy, you're awesome!*

### Mona Lisa's Smile

My most ambitious project is [Mona Lisa's Smile](/casting/mona-lisa/), where I am photographing portraits of women with a big secret.

### Every Advantage

Every Advantage is a photojournalism project where I'm writing about privilege from the perspective of a straight white male livin' in America. Once I have a better grasp of what I want to do with this I'll no doubt be asking for subjects and recommendations.

### Selphie

TBD
