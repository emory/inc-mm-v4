## Firstly

I am, as of January 17, 2018, divorced.

The Estranged Dr. Lundberg and I are still doing things our own way and it's been something I am proud of.

### In General

- My garage still has a metric assload of crap in it and no room for a car. 
- I have taken my kids on two road trips exceeding 3 hours in the car and I survived.

## Work

- I am the Principal Security Engineer for Auth0 and am obsessively preoccupied with our security operations team.
 
### Other Efforts

- I posted an intermission episode of [the hellyeah! show](http://show.hellyeah.com/) just to say "hi".
- Therapy is going well, so generally I'm doing well. 
- I am pleased to report that my heart isn't damaged in any lasting way by my divorce; I'm madly in love and it's all kinds of amazing.

## Free/Busy

* You can see the Free/Busy status of [My Personal Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/emory%40hellyeah.com/public/basic.ics) but be aware this doesn't include my Free/Busy on campus, nor my travel calendar.
