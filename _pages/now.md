# Firstly

> I have recieved my Pfirst dose of the Pfizer vaccine!

I am surviving the pandemic pretty well, as are my children and loved ones. I've had some friends and family that caught COVID-18, we've had a few exposures but so far so good and e're trying to get vaccines for everyone ASAP. My mental health is excellent, all things considered, and I'm on a waiting list for a really promising treatment protocol and pilot program at UIHC that I'm trying to not get too excited about but can't help myself.

I was looking for the right place to work for quite a while and found it! My coach was pretty great and I really benefited from her assistance. I accepted a position as a contractor at Comcast NBC/Universal running threatmodeling workshops. I've attended threatmodels before and was familiar with the practice, but at a place as big as Comcast NBCU it can be a full time occupation and I absolutely love it. I get to meet so many people that are building so many incredible things, and then I have to find out if I can possibly contribute anything to their continued success and assure the integrity and reputation of their inventions. When everyone got sent home due to COVID-19, I was able to use what I had learned while working at a company that was 85% remote and I'm really proud of our team being able to pivot so quickly into doing _more_ workshops than we were doing before the pandemic, and I believe the outcomes are better too. Kind of great to turn lemons into sparkling lemonade. 

Being able to do work that I love and still ensure my kids are getting what they need is really important to me. The things I said that I needed or wanted a couple of years ago while talking to my coach have essentially all come true, so that's pretty great. There is still plenty of tuning to do to find the right balance but right now I'm just catching my breath a bit and allowing myself a little time to recognize what I've been able to accomplish in the last 18 months.

## Having said that

I've been driving the 15 hours between PHL and IOW and haven't flown since March 2020. I am in Iowa City 2-6 weeks at a time, drive to Philly for 2 weeks, then drive back again. It's a long drive and I've spent a whole day in my car quite a bit in the last year and seeing how different states have responded to COVID-19 has been infuriating or inspiring depending on what state I'm in.

I will probably fly occasionally once I'm vaccinated and things are feeling saner, but I think I'll probably keep some driving in there. After I arrive wherever I'm going I'm ready for bed and as I am laying there in my bed I can feel the seams of the concrete echo through my body for hours after I get out of the car. I use the time to catch up on podcasts or audiobooks, calling friends and fmaily I haven't talked to a while — it's been great in a lot of ways but it would be much better if I were in a car that didn't need me to drive. Don't get me wrong, I love driving, and driving a car I enjoy driving improves my mood quite a bit. But I can't help but think those drives would be better if I could get into the car, push a button for Home 1 or Home 2 and arrive without my constant supervision.

## Games

I've been playing The Last of Us 2 on PS4 and waiting for PS5s to be available for purchase. I've been playing a lot of games on my Nintendo Switch lately. I logged a lot of time in Apex Legends on PS4 but the Switch version is starting from scratch so I don't know if I'll be playing much of that. I have not checked out WoW Classic or the current xpacs ever since May 2012, if I can't play that game competitively I don't want to play it at all for some reason. I'm totally fine being Casual at Eve Echoes or any of the Apple Arcade games, but WoW is not a casual game for me.

## In General

- I have been learning drone photography; I'm flying a DJI Mavic Mini. I'm still better with one of my Fujifilm X-series cameras, though.
- My garage still has _1 metric assload_ [^assload] of crap in it, and no room for a car. Yet.
  - I am considering hiring one of those professional organizers to come over and un-clutter my house.

## Other Efforts

- I posted an intermission episode of [the hellyeah! show](http://show.hellyeah.com/) just to say "hi".
- I am pleased to report that my heart isn't noticeably damaged in any persistent way following the events of 2017.
- My partner lives in Philly, and neither of us likes that we aren't living our lives together in the way we'd like. It's complicated, but we obviously want what is best for our children. 
  - I never expected to be in Iowa City this long, and it usually feels like I'm living someone else's life. I don't really feel like I have a place that is Home. I have People that are Home.
- I'm working on my photography and feeling really good about it and having fun doing it.
