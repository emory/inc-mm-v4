## Firstly

I'm presently (2017-05-02) in the middle of a (collaborative) divorce after 12 years of marriage. It's a project with a lot of moving parts and it's going very smoothly and without a lot of anger on either side. We have two children and we are family for life, so we're invested in having that family be one we're proud of.

### In General

- therapy! lots of it, and it's finally getting me the results i never dreamed of
- introspection and growth emotionally and otherwise
- wanting to bicycle more and resume aikido again
