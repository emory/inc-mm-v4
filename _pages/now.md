## Firstly

I'm *still* (2017-10-17) in the middle of a (collaborative) divorce after 12 years of marriage. 
The Estranged and I are wrapping up a couple of details and we may be filing within a couple of 
weeks. 

### In General

- My garage still has a metric assload of crap in it and no room for a car. 
- I have taken my kids on two road trips exceeding 3 hours in the car and I survived.

## Work

- I'm leaving the University of Iowa and start working for Auth0 at the end of October. I'm super excited!
 
### Other Efforts

- I posted an intermission episode of [the hellyeah! show](http://show.hellyeah.com/) just to say "hi".
- Therapy is going well, so generally I'm doing well. 
- I am pleased to report that my heart isn't damaged in any lasting way by my divorce; I'm madly in love and it's all kinds of amazing.

## Free/Busy

* You can see the Free/Busy status of [My Personal Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/emory%40hellyeah.com/public/basic.ics) but be aware this doesn't include my Free/Busy on campus, nor my travel calendar.
