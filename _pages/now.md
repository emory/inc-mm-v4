# Firstly

- Updated my X.509 cert and gnupg public key on the *About* page. No compromise of keys as far as I know, just added an intermediate CA and my old gnupg key had expired. Keybase is your best bet still if you want to use pgp/gnupg because I'm lazy about updating exported keys here, obviously. I try to update keyservers but with that whole "let's DoS keyservers with useless data" thing going around I'd recommend using Keybase.
- *I'm looking to make a change* so I'm currently **interested in job opportunities that let me leverage my somewhat unique experience and expertise**.
  - I decided that I need to find a place where I can get some coaching and mentoring into being suitable for more strategic roles that lets me do more of the things I'm really excellent at and less of the things that don't *spark joy*. I really loved my team at Auth0, and I recommend their services without hesitation.
- I recently became certified to practice Reiki, specifically [Holy Fire Reiki](https://www.reiki.org/HF3.html). I don't intend to open a practice or anything, it was more about caring for the people around me. Having said that, if you want to try Reiki I can make that happen! You don't even have to believe in Reiki for it to work, so don't let your skepticism hold you back!
- I am, as of January 17, 2018, divorced.
- Our two children (7 and 4) are doing well, and our youngest is no longer being considered high risk and appears to have no lasting complications from his [rather traumatic birth](/coolkids/)!
- I live in Iowa City but also spent about 100 hours of 2018 in airplanes and so far about 60 hours in airplanes for 2019, traveling between Iowa City and Philadelphia. I'm still terrified of flying.

## In General

- My garage still has _1 metric assload_ [^assload] of crap in it, and no room for a car. Yet.
  - I have the name and number of a dumpster rental company that I may end up using, and then also:
  - I am considering hiring one of those professional organizers to come over and un-clutter my house.

## Other Efforts

- I posted an intermission episode of [the hellyeah! show](http://show.hellyeah.com/) just to say "hi".
- I am pleased to report that my heart isn't noticeably damaged in any persistent way following the events of 2017.
- My partner lives in Philly, and neither of us likes that we aren't living our lives together in the way we'd like. It's complicated sometimes, but we obviously want what is best for our children. 
  - I never expected to be in Iowa City this long, and it feels like I'm living someone else's life.
- I'm working on my photography and feeling really good about my capabilities as a photographer and find it a very rewarding creative pursuit.
