# Firstly

- I am, as of January 17, 2018, divorced.
- The Estranged Dr. Lundberg and I are still doing things our own way and it's been something I am proud of.

## In General

- My garage still has a metric assload of crap in it and no room for a car. 
- I have taken my kids on two road trips exceeding 4 hours in the car and we survived.
- I am considering hiring one of those profesional organizers to come over and un-fuck my house.

# Work

- I am the Principal Security Engineer for Auth0 and am obsessively preoccupied with our security operations team.
 
## Other Efforts

- I posted an intermission episode of [the hellyeah! show](http://show.hellyeah.com/) just to say "hi".
- Therapy is going well, so generally I'm doing well. 
- I am pleased to report that my heart isn't noticeably damaged in any persistent way following the events of 2017.
