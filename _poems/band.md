# band

on my dresser (glass<br />
of water) i found an<br />
elastic band (nearly<br />
in-<br />
visible)<br />
that mere days ago <br />
held<br />
your hair 
and <br />
i held it in my hand<br />
to imagine <br />
and re-<br />
member<br />
your hair<br />
in my face<br />
when<br />
your delirium<br />
set<br />
in. <br />
