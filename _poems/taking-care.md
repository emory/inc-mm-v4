taking care of me;<br />
you *(who so adept at me knows,*<br />
*better than any)* know where i need nourished<br />
naturally<br />
supernaturally.<br />
<br />
tip your heart out; into me opened<br />
and wide soulful *(impossibly how this even is)*<br />
<br />
i am grateful *(and could say so)*<br />
but allow me the<br />
absolute pleasure *(instead and also)* of<br />
these expressions of my ador-<br />
ation, head to toe,<br />
and then<br />
<br /><br />
*(please my sweetheart, my kitten, my baby, mine)*<br />
accept the same *(don't make me say it)* <br />
upon every single parcel you present to me,<br />
from the infinite expanse<br />
of your heart?<br />
