While reading about myself [^ENFP] on Wikipedia again, I noticed the following at the bottom:

## Correlation with Enneatype
(Barron & Wagele 1994) report that the most common Enneatypes for ENFPs are [Helpers (Twos)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Twos) and [Enthusiasts (Sevens)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Sevens).

I've read a little here and there about Enneatypes but couldn't help but notice: holy shit, yes.

Of the two, *Helper* seems much more like me than *Enthusiast* even though I share some traits with that Enneatype (the planning and gluttony). *Helper* (and the stress/security modifiers when stressed or secure) breaks down like this:

| Type | Characteristic role | Ego fixation | Holy idea | Basic fear | Basic desire | Temptation | Vice or Passion | Virtue | Stress | Security | 
|:--:|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | Helper | Flattery (Ingratiation) | Freedom, Will | Being unloved | To feel love | Deny own needs, manipulation | Pride | Humility | 8 | 4 |
| 4 | Individualist | Melancholy (Fantasizing) | Origin | Having no identity or significance | To be uniquely themselves | To overuse imagination in search of self | Envy | Equanimity (Emotional Balance) | 6 | 3 |
| 8 | Challenger | Vengeance (Objectification) | Truth | Being harmed, controlled, violated | Self-protection | Thinking they are completely self-sufficient | Lust (Forcefulness) | Innocence | 5 | 2 | 

It's absolutely accurate. I also have an idea about that alleged *Innocence* virtue when I'm stressed. I have been especially wary of getting cozy with that *Challenger* aspect when I'm stressed without even knowing that's what I was doing. Be gone, *Challenger*. And now if you'll excuse me I'll be overusing my imagination while thinking about my sadness (because *Individualist*).
