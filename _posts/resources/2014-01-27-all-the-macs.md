# Macs I Have Known and Loved
The 30th anniversary of the Mac has reminded me of all the delightful Macs I've known and loved over the years. Some of them were better than others but each of them stands out in their own way.

1. [Mac 512KE][1] [^1] that had been upgraded with a Mac Plus ROM and 2.5MB of RAM and the addition of external SCSI. Still with an 800KB floppy drive, though.
2. [Quadra 630][2] 
3. [Power Mac 6100][3]
4. [PowerBook Duo 280c][4]
5. [Power Mac 7500][5]
6. [Power Mac G3 (Beige desktop)][6]
7. [Power Mac 9500 180MP baller workstation that ran BeOS and Mac OS 9][7]
8. [PowerBook G3 Wallstreet][8]
9. [PowerMac G3 Blue & White][9]
10. [PowerBook G3 Lombard][10] [^2]
11. [PowerMac G4 Yikes][11]
12. [PowerMac G4 Sawtooth][12]
13. [PowerMac G4 SnakeBite Dual G4][13]
14. [iBook Dual USB][14] 
15. [PowerBook G4 Ti][15]
16. [iMac DV SE][16]
17. [PowerBook G4 12"][17]
18. [PowerMac G5 Omega dual 1.8GHz][18]
19. [iMac 17" iMac4,1][19]
20. [MacBook Black][20]
21. [MacBook Pro 2,1 or 2,2][21]
22. [iMac 24"][22] 
23. [MacBook Air][23]
24. [MacBook Air 11" core 2 duo][24] [^3]
25. [MacBook Air 13" core i][25] *ex-wife has it* <i class="fa fa-icon-thumbs-up"></i>
26. [Retina MacBook Pro 15" TouchBar][26] *still got it* <i class="fa fa-icon-thumbs-up"></i>
27. [MacBook Pro 13" TouchBar core i7][27] 
28. [MacPro3,1 Quad-Core Intel Xeon][28] vintage from 2008 and idles at about 80% utilization

## Unexpected Entry

1. 2020 iPad Pro 12.9" *still got it* 
It definitely isn't a Mac, but it's probably where I do most of my creative work these days. I was skeptical that Apple could ever ship an iPad that would allow me to work from a device that can fit in with whatever is around me, and to do so with a battery that can guarantee I'm not leashed to an outlet all day long.

The 2020 iPad Pro is my preferred computer now, and I have several things I'd like to write about. Hopefully I'll get to those items in OmniFocus sooner rather than later! The biggest hurdle I had to clear was getting my photography processing into a workflow I can do in Lightroom CC for iPadOS. After a rocky beginning (on the part of Adobe completely destroying my Lightroom Classic presets and profiles twice costing me about 20 hours of time to recover and re-stage upgrades properly, it's finally something I'm enjoying. 

## In the racks of fine datacenters 

These have been powered down after years of faithful service:

1. [Power Mac G3 (Beige tower)][28]
1. [Mac Mini G4][29] (hungus)
1. [Xserve G5 Cluster Node][30] (autobahn)

## Hacs *(ahem)*

These are self-built systems built for OS X but aren't Macs. They're fickle and bitchy like a Blue & White G3. I often tell people that having a Hacintosh is a lot like flying the Millennium Falcon — they're fast hunks of junk that require frequent tune-ups and a completely different set of limitations and restrictions from Apple's hardware. My Hacintoshing probably needs some better documentation because hobbyist computing is more on the fringe than it has ever been.

1. Hacintosh 1: Yorkfield Intel Core 2 quad-core 9550 (12M of cache, ladies)
1. Hacintosh 2: SandyBridge Intel Core i7 2600K 
1. Hacintosh 3: Haswell Intel Core i7 4790K *still got it* <i class="fa fa-icon-thumbs-up"></i>

### Apple's 30 Years of Mac

<a href="http://www.apple.com/30-years/" class="link">Apple's Thirty Years of Mac site has a delightful interactive timeline and user stories. With a design and performance heritage that rivals some car companies (think Audi, Porsche, BMW, Mercedes, VW) there is surely a Mac for every user as time goes on.</a>

[^2]:	The first PowerBook to receive a model designation of PowerBook, i.e. PowerBook1,1.
